Examples from Week 3 of OKCoders

## Setup

* On one comand line session
    * npm install
    * mongodb --dbpath db/
* on another command line run:
    * npm start

Application should be running on localhost:3000

* To stop to mongo server
brew services stop mongodb
ps aux|grep mongo
kill -9 624

require looks in the current folder first
    if it doesn't have a path, then looks in node modules
